# Python Asteroids

Asteroids made in Python, based on the 1979 version for Atari.

Using pygame, every single entity in the game is drawn as polygons or lines. No sprites or images were used in the main game. Everything is hard coded and calculated, angles, collisions, etc. The goal was to make the game as "mathematical" as possible, yikes.

The code is a mess, I know. We where mainly focused on finishing and having the visuals running. After we got the game running, we didn't have the time to clean everything, so... yeah.

- You have 3 lives;
- Each asteroid you break gives you a different amount of points, depending on it's size;
